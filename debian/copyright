License: public-domain
 All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
 domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies
 they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
 public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
 at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,
 compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
 form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
 and by any means.
 .
 The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in
 SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship
 with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for
 example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other
 open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final
 deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those
 scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the
 SQLite library.
 .
 All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code
 has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of
 code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
 public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is
 uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
